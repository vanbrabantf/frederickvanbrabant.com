# AI usage on this website

I occasionally use AI tools for research purposes, and any research generated by these tools is carefully vetted and verified. All the text that is written on this blog is from my own mind, and I like to keep it that way; it is Frederick Vanbrabant's delirous rantings after all.

I do, however, use a spell checker; it might include AI, but I'm personally okay with that. It will, in the worst case, restructure the sentences, not the information.

The header images are generated by AI as they are mainly decoration. I could use stock images, but the result would be the same.

This page is inspired by [Damola Morenikeji's AI manifesto](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto)
